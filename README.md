# Gomoku
This is a program for the Japanese game Gomoku, written at the end of April 2016. This is an Java Applet program that is written to run in Eclipse. All the code is put into one file so the code is a bit hard to read. And again, this code was written long ago, so it has lots of flows but is easy to understand for Java beginners.
